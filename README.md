# learn-gRPC

Let me learn and know what is gRPC ???

## Motivation

`gRPC` can use protocol buffers as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format. 
If you’re new to gRPC and/or protocol buffers, read this! If you just want to dive in and see gRPC in action first, run project and try it.

## Download and Installation

```
$ npm install

## Usage

```

```
$ cd learn-gRPC
`learn-gRPC` is the directory where I store my dev projects. 

```
